# snake in Prossing, Java

<h1>How it works</h1>
There are three files

The main file containing setup(), draw(), keyPressed() & the custom function init()
The file containing all functions that draw to the screen
The file containing all functions that perform the operations

<h1>Customizability</h1>

In the beginning of the main file, you will find the constants:

gridSize
speed
defaultDirection
uKey
dKey
lKey
rKey
reset

These are the only things that should be changed normally. They are explained how
to use and what values are valid within the program.
